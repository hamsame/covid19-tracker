# Covid19 Tracker

# Project Introduction
This is a covid 19 tracker which uses the COVID-19 API(https://covid19api.com/) Built by Kyle Redelinghuys. 

The first part of the web app shows the global cases, recoveries, deaths, and new data in three columns.

The second part is a button which makes an AJAX request which requests the data then parses it into a div for each country. Onced parsed the divs will be placed into three columns.


# What Technologies Did I Use?
In this project I used HTML,SCSS or reusable "mixins" to keep my code brief, Materialize CSS a front-end framework, Line Awesome for icons and JavaScript for information requests using AJAX. I have also imported fonts from Google.

# How Did I Create This Project?
I hard coded some of the HTML markup such as the navbar and divs below the quick stats heading. I used the JavaScript selectors to target certain elements and parsed in fetched data using DOM Manipulation. 


# What Kind of Problems Have I Faced?
I had difficulty accessing values from arrays and objects using object destructuring.

# What Could I Do To Improve?
To improve this project I could:
- Add a search box which filters the all the data to the user input
- Add a dropdown list where the user can data on a particular country.
